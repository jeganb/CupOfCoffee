<p> Go to http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ with your browser, get the Notepad++ text editor, and install it. You do not need to be the administrator to do this.
Make sure you can get to Notepad++ easily by putting it on your desktop and/or in Quick Launch. Both options are available during setup.
Run PowerShell from the Start menu. Search for it and you can just press Enter to run it.
Make a shortcut to it on your desktop and/or Quick Launch for your convenience.
Run your PowerShell program (which I will call Terminal later). It won't look like much.
In your PowerShell (Terminal) program, run ruby -v. 
You run things in Terminal by just typing the command name and pressing Enter.</p>
